Date and time %input is accepted in almost any reasonable format,
including ISO ~%8601, SQL-compatible, traditional POSTGRES, and others.
For some formats, ordering of day, month, and year in date input is
ambiguous and there is support for specifying the expected ordering
of these fields. Set the DateStyle parameter to MDY to select month-day-year
interpretation, DMY to select day-month-year interpretation, or YMD
to select year-month-day interpretation.
